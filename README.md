# produx-2nd-final-project

This is our Final Project for our 1st Semester in 2nd Year, derived from our previous project from the last semester of 1st year. As the lead programmer of this project, we made significant improvements on different features of this program compared to the first version. This project was challenging but very rewarding in the end because I have learned a lot in the process. This might be our last Java Swing project, it has been a lot of fun.
